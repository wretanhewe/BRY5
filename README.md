# The BRY-5 Droid Project
BRY-5 aka "Barry Five" droid.

WIP - Code Repostory for this project, ongoing personal effort, though contributions and interest is welcome! 
Will be learning the technologies and tools (including git) as we go. This is a project to grow and advance over a long period, and become a platform for doing even more in robotics, machine learning, vision, electrical design, mechanical design, system control, neural networking and machine intelligence, learning, communication, personal assistance, networking, and anything else that a robot could conceivably be programmed to do, with the sensors it will possess.

Repo is now public for the sake of sharing the progress with those interested, to follow updates, or contribute, if desired!
