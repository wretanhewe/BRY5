This project is in it's early stages, as is my familiarity with GIT. Feel free, if joining as a contributor, to make forks and test out some code on a Raspberry Pi yourself!  
Collaboration is part of the idea of this project, and with more people trying features, BRY-5 could become quite the droid indeed.
